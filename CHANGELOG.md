## [0.2.9] - 2025-10-05

### Added
- Level animation support for all fractal sponge types via `--animate frames=N:level=start-end`
- Overlay rendering mode with `--face-color` and `--line-color` options for wireframe on transparent
  faces

## [0.2.8] - 2025-10-04

### Added
- Scalafix integration for code quality and automated refactoring
- Fractional level support for SpongeBySurface with smooth alpha transitions
- FractionalLevelSponge trait to eliminate code duplication between sponge implementations
- Fractional level support for TesseractSponge and TesseractSponge2 via FractionalRotatedProjection
  wrapper

### Fixed
- Path traversal vulnerability in screenshot filename handling with comprehensive test coverage
- Improved timing precision by replacing System.currentTimeMillis with System.nanoTime
- Made getIntegerModel a lazy val to prevent repeated sponge instantiation in render loop
- Corrected alpha calculation for fractional level sponges to properly transition from full opacity 
  to transparency
- Eliminated code duplication by moving createMaterialWithAlpha to FractionalLevelSponge companion 
  object
